## Goal of the Game
The goal of the game is to match the identical card pairs until there is no more
cards to match and within the number of moves limit. The faster you complete this
goal and using fewer moves will result in a better star rating (0 stars for 
losing, 1-4 stars if you win and based on time/number of moves used). If you exceed
the max number of moves (3), then you lose the game.

## Instructions

To start the game simply click any of the cards. The timer will begin. Clicking a card
will reveal the card. After you select a second card, if the 2 revealed cards match, then
 they will stay open. If the 2 revealed cards do not match, then they will be hidden.
